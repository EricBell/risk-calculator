# Implementation Plan: Qt Migration with Responsive Window Management

**Branch**: `004-i-want-to` | **Date**: 2025-09-21 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-i-want-to/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Migrate the existing Tkinter-based risk calculator application to Qt framework while adding responsive window management. Primary requirements include proportional UI scaling during window resize, persistent window configuration storage in user's home directory, and support for high-resolution displays. All existing risk calculation functionality (equity, options, futures) must be preserved with identical mathematical accuracy.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (preserving existing codebase compatibility)
**Primary Dependencies**: PyQt6/PySide6 for Qt framework, existing risk calculation services, decimal library for financial calculations
**Storage**: JSON configuration files in user's home directory for window settings
**Testing**: pytest with existing test suite structure (contract, integration, unit tests)
**Target Platform**: Windows 10+ and Linux desktop (cross-platform desktop application)
**Project Type**: single (desktop application)
**Performance Goals**: <3 second application startup, <100ms UI response time, 60fps smooth resizing
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, offline-capable, no server dependencies, high-DPI display support
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, existing codebase migration (~50 Python files), 3 trading asset types

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Desktop-First ✅
- All functionality works without server-side processing: Qt-based local calculations
- Native code handles all calculations locally: Preserving existing Python calculation services
- No backend dependencies for core features: Offline-capable configuration storage
- Cross-platform compatibility: Qt provides Windows and Linux native support

### II. Native UI Design ✅
- Native desktop experience: Qt provides platform-appropriate widgets and styling
- Mouse and keyboard optimized: Qt input handling with keyboard navigation
- Platform-appropriate UI guidelines: Qt automatically follows platform conventions

### III. Performance ✅
- Application startup under 3 seconds: Qt generally faster than Tkinter, existing services preserved
- No external dependencies for core functionality: All risk calculations remain local
- Minimal memory footprint: Qt efficient, targeting <100MB as per existing constraints

### IV. Accessibility ✅
- Platform accessibility standards: Qt provides built-in accessibility APIs
- Keyboard navigation support: Qt widgets include standard keyboard navigation
- Screen reader compatibility: Qt integrates with platform accessibility services

### V. Platform Compatibility ✅
- Support Windows 10+ and Linux: Qt officially supports both target platforms
- Python runtime dependency management: PyQt6/PySide6 available via pip, same as existing
- Graceful handling of missing components: Qt fallback mechanisms for missing system features
- Cross-platform executable distribution: Qt + PyInstaller proven packaging solution

**PASS**: All constitutional requirements met. Qt migration enhances rather than compromises constitutional compliance.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Desktop application maintains existing MVC structure with Qt views replacing Tkinter components

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Window Management Interface → contract test tasks [P]
- Qt View Interface → contract test tasks [P]
- Window Configuration, Display Profile, UI Layout State → model creation tasks [P]
- Quickstart scenarios → integration test tasks
- Qt widget migration → implementation tasks (Tkinter to Qt)
- PySide6 installation and setup → environment tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Models → Qt Views → Controllers → Integration tests
- Dependency order: Configuration models → Window management → View migration → Controller adaptation
- Infrastructure first: PySide6 setup → Qt application bootstrap → Widget replacements
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/components)

**Qt-Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Environment Setup**: PySide6 installation, Qt application initialization
2. **Configuration Management**: QSettings integration, window state persistence
3. **Widget Migration**: Tkinter → Qt widget replacements (Entry→QLineEdit, etc.)
4. **Layout Migration**: Grid/Pack layouts → QGridLayout/QVBoxLayout
5. **Event System Migration**: Variable traces → Qt signals/slots
6. **High-DPI Support**: Qt scaling attributes and display detection
7. **Cross-Platform Testing**: Windows and Linux validation

**Estimated Output**: 30-35 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
