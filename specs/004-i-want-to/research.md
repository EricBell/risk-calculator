# Research: Qt Migration with Responsive Window Management

## Framework Selection

### Decision: PySide6 over PyQt6
**Rationale**:
- LGPL licensing vs GPL (better for potential commercial distribution)
- Official Qt Company support and faster updates
- Better long-term sustainability for desktop applications
- Same API surface as PyQt6, minimal migration risk

**Alternatives considered**: PyQt6 rejected due to licensing constraints for potential future distribution needs.

## Widget Migration Mapping

### Decision: Direct widget replacement strategy
**Rationale**:
- Tkinter Entry → QLineEdit (improved input validation)
- Tkinter Label → QLabel (better font scaling support)
- Tkinter Button → QPushButton (native platform styling)
- Tkinter Frame → QWidget/QGroupBox (better layout control)
- Tkinter Notebook → QTabWidget (enhanced tab management)

**Alternatives considered**: Custom widget wrappers rejected due to unnecessary complexity and performance overhead.

## Event Handling Migration

### Decision: Signals/Slots pattern over variable traces
**Rationale**:
- Qt's signal/slot system provides type-safe event handling
- Better performance than Tkinter variable traces
- Native support for real-time validation
- Cleaner separation of concerns

**Alternatives considered**: Maintaining Tkinter-style variable traces rejected due to Qt's superior event handling paradigm.

## Layout Management

### Decision: QGridLayout as primary layout manager
**Rationale**:
- Direct mapping from Tkinter grid() system
- Excellent responsive behavior for window resizing
- Built-in stretch factors for proportional scaling
- Better than QVBoxLayout/QHBoxLayout for complex forms

**Alternatives considered**: Mixed layout approach rejected for consistency and maintenance complexity.

## Responsive Window Management

### Decision: QMainWindow with central widget scaling
**Rationale**:
- Built-in support for window state persistence
- Automatic layout recalculation on resize
- Native high-DPI scaling support
- Platform-appropriate minimum size handling

**Alternatives considered**: Manual resize handling rejected due to Qt's superior built-in capabilities.

## High-DPI Support

### Decision: Qt.AA_EnableHighDpiScaling application attribute
**Rationale**:
- Automatic scaling on high-resolution displays
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Linux)
- No code changes required in business logic
- Better than manual DPI detection and scaling

**Alternatives considered**: Manual DPI scaling rejected due to maintenance complexity and platform differences.

## Configuration Management

### Decision: QSettings for window persistence
**Rationale**:
- Native configuration storage (Registry on Windows, config files on Linux)
- Built-in type safety and validation
- Automatic platform-appropriate storage locations
- Better than custom JSON files for system integration

**Alternatives considered**: JSON configuration files rejected for inferior platform integration.

## Business Logic Preservation

### Decision: Adapter pattern for controller integration
**Rationale**:
- Preserve existing calculation services unchanged
- Create Qt-specific view adapters for existing controllers
- Minimal risk to tested business logic
- Gradual migration capability

**Alternatives considered**: Complete rewrite rejected due to unnecessary risk and development time.

## Performance Considerations

### Decision: Lazy loading and event debouncing
**Rationale**:
- Qt's event loop more efficient than Tkinter
- Built-in support for resize event debouncing
- Native font caching for better scaling performance
- Memory usage typically lower than Tkinter

**Alternatives considered**: Aggressive optimization rejected as premature without performance bottlenecks.

## Migration Strategy

### Decision: View-first incremental migration
**Rationale**:
- Replace UI components while keeping business logic
- Maintain testability throughout migration
- Lower risk than big-bang rewrite
- Easier debugging and validation

**Alternatives considered**: Complete rewrite rejected due to higher risk and longer development cycle.
