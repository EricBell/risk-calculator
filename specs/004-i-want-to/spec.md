# Feature Specification: Qt Migration with Responsive Window Management

**Feature Branch**: `004-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to start from 001... branch and reimplement this app using Qt instead of tkinger as the ui framework. I want add feature at the same time - I want to resize the app window and have the labels/fields resize proportionally too. The problem on this laptop is high resolution display shows the default dimensions that work on lower resolution screens dont work here. Resizing the window should fix my problem. Also I want the size of the window to be saved as a config file in my home directory. When the app starts on any computer it's default size will be custom for that environment."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a day trader using a high-resolution display, I need the risk calculator application to automatically adapt to my screen resolution and remember my preferred window size so that I can use the application comfortably without manually adjusting dimensions every time I launch it.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is launched for the first time on a high-resolution display, **When** the user resizes the window to a comfortable size, **Then** the application saves these dimensions and position to a configuration file in the user's home directory
2. **Given** the application has been used before and window preferences exist, **When** the user launches the application, **Then** the window opens at the previously saved size and position
3. **Given** the user is resizing the application window, **When** the window dimensions change, **Then** all labels, input fields, and UI elements scale proportionally to maintain usability
4. **Given** the user moves to a different computer with different screen resolution, **When** the application launches, **Then** it uses default dimensions appropriate for that system if no configuration exists
5. **Given** the saved window configuration would place the window off-screen or at invalid dimensions, **When** the application launches, **Then** it falls back to safe default dimensions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the configuration file is corrupted or contains invalid values?
- How does the system handle multiple monitor setups where saved coordinates might be invalid?
- What happens when the user's home directory is not writable?
- How does the application behave on systems with very small screens where minimum window size requirements cannot be met?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all existing risk calculation functionality (equity, options, futures trading) with identical mathematical accuracy
- **FR-002**: System MUST save window dimensions (width, height) and position (x, y coordinates) to a configuration file in the user's home directory whenever the window is resized or moved
- **FR-003**: System MUST restore previously saved window dimensions and position when the application launches
- **FR-004**: System MUST proportionally resize all UI elements (labels, input fields, buttons, tabs) when the user resizes the application window
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide appropriate default window dimensions for first-time users based on their display resolution
- **FR-006**: System MUST enforce minimum window dimensions to ensure usability (all essential UI elements remain accessible)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate saved window configuration to prevent off-screen positioning or invalid dimensions
- **FR-008**: System MUST gracefully fallback to default dimensions when configuration file is missing, corrupted, or contains invalid data
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain all existing risk calculation methods (percentage-based, fixed amount, level-based) with identical functionality
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all existing input validation and error handling behaviors
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain cross-platform compatibility (Windows and Linux)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Window Configuration**: Stores user's preferred window dimensions, position, and display-specific settings; persisted between application sessions
- **Display Profile**: Represents characteristics of the user's display (resolution, DPI scaling) to determine appropriate default sizing
- **UI Layout State**: Tracks current scaling ratios and element positioning to enable proportional resizing
