*Production-ready Qt application with enhanced capabilities and comprehensive testing*

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   â†’ If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   â†’ Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   â†’ data-model.md: Extract entities â†’ model tasks
   â†’ contracts/: Each file â†’ contract test task
   â†’ research.md: Extract decisions â†’ setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   â†’ Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   â†’ Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   â†’ Core: models, services, Qt views
   â†’ Integration: window management, configuration
   â†’ Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   â†’ Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   â†’ Same file = sequential (no [P])
   â†’ Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   â†’ All contracts have tests?
   â†’ All entities have models?
   â†’ All Qt views implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify contract tests fail before implementing interfaces
- Preserve existing business logic during Qt migration
- Test on both Windows and Linux throughout development
- Maintain existing calculation accuracy exactly
- Commit after each task completion

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - window_management_interface.py â†’ T004-T006 (WindowManager, ResponsiveLayout, DisplayProfile)
   - qt_view_interface.py â†’ T007-T009 (QtView, QtMainWindow, QtTradingTab)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Window Configuration â†’ T015 (model creation)
   - Display Profile â†’ T016 (model creation)
   - UI Layout State â†’ T017 (model creation)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Scenario 1 â†’ T010 (high-DPI integration test)
   - Scenario 2 â†’ T011 (window persistence integration test)
   - Scenario 3 â†’ T012 (calculation preservation integration test)
   - Scenario 4 â†’ T013 (cross-platform integration test)
   - Scenario 5 â†’ T014 (edge cases integration test)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup â†’ Tests â†’ Models â†’ Services â†’ Views â†’ Controllers â†’ Integration â†’ Polish
   - Qt-specific dependencies: QSettings before persistence, models before services

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T004-T009)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T015-T017)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T004-T014 before T015+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Qt-specific requirements addressed (high-DPI, persistence, responsive)
- [x] Existing functionality preservation validated (calculation accuracy)
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility ensured (Windows + Linux)

## Migration Strategy Notes
- **Incremental approach**: Keep existing Tkinter code functional during development
- **Adapter pattern**: Create Qt adapters for existing controllers to minimize business logic changes
- **Testing strategy**: Ensure Qt calculations produce identical results to Tkinter version
- **Rollback plan**: Maintain ability to revert to Tkinter if critical issues arise
