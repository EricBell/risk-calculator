# Feature Specification: Windows Desktop Risk Calculator for Daytrading

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-windows`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a windows desktop app taking inputs for daytrading trades, calculate the risk size for equities, options and futures. The mvp has tabs, one for each of the asset classes just enumerated."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Description: Windows desktop app for daytrading risk calculation
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Daytraders
   � Actions: Input trade parameters, calculate risk size
   � Data: Trade inputs, risk calculations, asset class parameters
   � Constraints: Windows desktop environment, MVP with tabs
3. Clarified aspects with reasonable assumptions:
   → Risk calculation: Percentage-based position sizing using account capital and stop loss distance
   → Account input: Total trading capital in dollars
   → Risk tolerance: Percentage of account per trade (1-5% range)
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary user flow: Select asset class � Input trade details � Calculate risk size
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement testable for MVP functionality
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Trade, Asset Class, Risk Parameters
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clarified with reasonable assumptions
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A daytrader wants to quickly determine the appropriate position size for a trade across different asset classes (equities, options, futures) by inputting trade parameters and receiving calculated risk sizing to maintain proper risk management within their trading account.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is open, **When** user selects the "Equities" tab and enters stock symbol, entry price ($50), stop loss ($45), account size ($10,000), and risk tolerance (2%), **Then** the system calculates and displays the maximum share quantity (40 shares) to risk $200
2. **Given** user is on the "Options" tab, **When** user enters option contract details, premium ($2.50), account size ($10,000), and risk tolerance (3%), **Then** the system calculates the appropriate number of contracts (12 contracts) to risk $300
3. **Given** user is on the "Futures" tab, **When** user enters futures contract specifications, margin requirement ($4,000), tick value ($12.50), account size ($25,000), and risk tolerance (2%), **Then** the system calculates position sizing (1 contract) based on $500 risk
4. **Given** user has entered invalid data (negative prices, missing fields, risk tolerance above 5%), **When** they attempt to calculate, **Then** the system displays clear error messages and prevents calculation
5. **Given** user switches between asset class tabs, **When** they return to a previously used tab, **Then** their previous inputs remain saved within the session
6. **Given** user enters a stop loss above entry price for a long position, **When** they attempt to calculate, **Then** the system displays an error message "Stop loss must be below entry price for long positions"
7. **Given** calculated position size exceeds available account capital, **When** calculation is performed, **Then** the system displays a warning and suggests reducing position size or risk tolerance

### Edge Cases
- How does the system handle risk tolerance settings below 1% or above 5%?
- What occurs when account size is insufficient for minimum position requirements?
- How does the system behave with extremely small entry prices (penny stocks) or large contract values?
- How does the system calculate risk when stop loss equals entry price (zero risk distance)?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a tabbed interface with three tabs: Equities, Options, and Futures
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept trade input parameters specific to each asset class (price, quantity, stop loss, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST calculate appropriate position sizing based on risk parameters and account size
- **FR-004**: System MUST display calculated results clearly showing recommended position size
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate all numeric inputs and prevent calculation with invalid data
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist user inputs within each tab during the application session
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messaging for invalid inputs or calculation errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate risk for equities using percentage of account with stop loss distance to determine position size
- **FR-009**: System MUST calculate options risk considering premium cost and number of contracts based on risk tolerance
- **FR-010**: System MUST calculate futures risk accounting for margin requirements, contract specifications, and tick values
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to input their account size or available capital for risk calculation
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow users to set risk tolerance as percentage of account (1-5% range) per trade

### Key Entities
- **Trade**: Represents a potential trading position with entry price, stop loss, asset type, and calculated risk parameters
- **Asset Class**: Defines the type of financial instrument (equity, option, future) with specific calculation requirements
- **Risk Parameters**: Contains account size, risk tolerance settings, and calculated position sizing results
- **Account**: Represents trader's capital and risk management settings for position sizing calculations
