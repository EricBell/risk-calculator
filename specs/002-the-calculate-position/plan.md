# Implementation Plan: Fix Calculate Position Button Always Disabled

**Branch**: `002-the-calculate-position` | **Date**: 2025-09-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-the-calculate-position/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Fix the Calculate Position button that remains disabled despite complete form input across all calculation tabs (equities, options, futures). The issue prevents users from performing risk calculations even when all required fields are filled and valid. Solution involves debugging and fixing the button enablement logic and form validation system.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Tkinter (standard library), decimal, dataclasses, typing  
**Storage**: In-memory session state (no persistence)  
**Testing**: pytest with unittest.mock  
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform desktop (Windows 10+, Linux)
**Project Type**: single (desktop application)  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms form validation response, real-time button state updates  
**Constraints**: <50MB memory usage, native UI guidelines, no external dependencies  
**Scale/Scope**: 3 calculation tabs, ~10-15 form fields total, single-user desktop app

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

✅ **Desktop-First**: Button enablement is purely client-side logic, no server dependencies  
✅ **Native UI Design**: Tkinter button state management follows platform conventions  
✅ **Performance**: Form validation and button updates will be <100ms, minimal overhead  
✅ **Accessibility**: Button state changes will be properly announced to screen readers  
✅ **Platform Compatibility**: Standard Tkinter form validation works across Windows/Linux  

**Status**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (single project) - Desktop application with existing MVC structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate debugging and testing tasks from Phase 1 contracts and quickstart scenarios
- Create systematic debugging approach for button enablement logic
- Generate targeted tests for each identified failure point
- Implementation tasks focused on fixing rather than building new features

**Specific Task Areas**:
1. **Debugging Tasks**: Investigate current button state logic, trace callback setup, validation error handling
2. **Contract Tests**: Verify button validation service interface compliance  
3. **Integration Tests**: Test real-time validation scenarios from quickstart.md
4. **Fix Implementation**: Targeted fixes for identified root causes
5. **Regression Tests**: Ensure fixes don't break existing functionality

**Ordering Strategy**:
- Investigation before implementation
- Tests before fixes (TDD approach)
- Critical path: Button logic → Field validation → Event binding → UI updates
- Mark [P] for parallel investigation tasks

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 focused debugging and fix tasks in tasks.md

**Focus**: This is a bug fix, not new feature development. Tasks will emphasize:
- Systematic debugging of existing logic
- Minimal code changes to fix root cause
- Comprehensive testing to prevent regression
- Performance validation for real-time validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
