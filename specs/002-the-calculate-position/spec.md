# Feature Specification: Fix Calculate Position Button Always Disabled

**Feature Branch**: `002-the-calculate-position`  
**Created**: 2025-09-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the 'calculate position' button is disabled all the time, I fill out all the fields and have all selections made. Fix this"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Bug report: Calculate Position button remains disabled despite complete form
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: User filling out form fields
   ’ Actions: Fill fields, make selections, attempt to calculate position
   ’ Data: Form fields and selections
   ’ Constraints: Button should enable when form is complete
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which specific fields are being filled?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes "all selections made"?]
   ’ [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which tab(s) are affected - equities, options, futures, or all?]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ User completes form ’ expects button to enable ’ can calculate position
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Button enablement logic must work correctly
   ’ Form validation must accurately detect completion
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Form fields, button state, validation logic
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ WARN "Spec has uncertainties about specific form fields"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user opens the risk calculator application, navigates to any calculation tab (equities, options, or futures), fills out all required form fields and makes all necessary selections, and expects the "Calculate Position" button to become enabled so they can perform the calculation.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user is on the equities tab with all fields empty, **When** the user fills in all required fields (account value, risk percentage, entry price, stop loss), **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled
2. **Given** the user is on the options tab with all fields empty, **When** the user fills in all required fields and selects calculation method, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled
3. **Given** the user is on the futures tab with all fields empty, **When** the user fills in all required fields and selects calculation method, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled
4. **Given** the user has filled out a form partially, **When** the user completes the remaining required fields, **Then** the button immediately becomes enabled
5. **Given** the user has a completed form with enabled button, **When** the user clears a required field, **Then** the button becomes disabled again

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user switches between tabs with partially filled forms?
- How does the button state behave when validation errors occur in individual fields?
- What happens if a user fills fields but with invalid data (e.g., negative numbers where positive required)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable the Calculate Position button when all required form fields contain valid data
- **FR-002**: System MUST disable the Calculate Position button when any required field is empty or contains invalid data
- **FR-003**: Button state MUST update immediately (real-time) as user types or changes field values
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain separate button state logic for each tab (equities, options, futures)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear visual indication of button state (enabled/disabled)
- **FR-006**: Form validation MUST check for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific validation rules for each field type - numeric ranges, required vs optional fields]
- **FR-007**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what happens with calculation method selection - is this required for all tabs or only some?]

### Key Entities
- **Form Fields**: Input fields that require validation (account value, risk amount, entry price, stop loss, etc.)
- **Calculate Button**: UI element that enables/disables based on form completion status
- **Validation State**: Current status of form completion and field validity
- **Tab Context**: Which calculation type is currently active (equities, options, futures)
