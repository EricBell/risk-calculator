# Feature Specification: UI Bug Fixes and Window Responsiveness

**Feature Branch**: `003-there-are-several`
**Created**: 2025-09-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "There are several bugs. The first is when all the fields are filled out the 'calculate position' button is gray and there's no error message. I'm not sure where to see an error message. The menu item to 'calculate position' is available but doesn't seem to do anything. second, I've run this app on different computers. Most of the time the app window is large enough to be used. On one of my laptops the screen resolution is very high so the default dimensions of the app window are insuficient. I want the app window to be resizable and responsive. When the window is resized all the screen elements should be resized appropriately and positioned correctly. When the resize manuver is complete, the dimensions and whatever else is needed to size the app on startup nexttime should be stored in the home folder of the user in the way other configuration informaiton is stored."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Identified multiple issues: disabled button bug, menu item bug, window sizing/responsiveness
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: desktop users across different devices
   � Actions: filling forms, calculating position, resizing windows
   � Data: form inputs, window dimensions, user preferences
   � Constraints: high-resolution displays, persistent settings
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Assumed configuration storage follows JSON format in ~/.risk_calculator/
   → Assumed minimum window size: 800x600, maximum: unrestricted but capped by screen size
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flows identified for both bug fixes and responsiveness
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Window configuration, user preferences, form validation states
7. Run Review Checklist
   → All requirements clarified with reasonable assumptions
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a trader using the risk calculator on various devices with different screen resolutions, I want the application to work reliably and adapt to my screen size so that I can calculate position sizes effectively regardless of my hardware setup.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** all required form fields are filled with valid data, **When** I look at the Calculate Position button, **Then** the button should be enabled (not grayed out) and clickable
2. **Given** the Calculate Position button is enabled, **When** I click it, **Then** the position calculation should execute and display results in the designated output area
3. **Given** I'm using the menu item to calculate position, **When** I select it, **Then** the calculation should execute if form data is valid, or display validation errors if invalid
4. **Given** I have an invalid form field (empty required field or invalid value), **When** I look at the interface, **Then** clear error messages should appear near the problematic field explaining what needs to be corrected
5. **Given** I'm on a high-resolution display where the default window appears too small, **When** I resize the window larger, **Then** all UI elements should scale proportionally and maintain proper spacing
6. **Given** I've resized the window to my preferred size and position, **When** I close and reopen the application, **Then** the window should restore to my previously saved size and position
7. **Given** the saved window dimensions exceed my current screen size, **When** I open the application, **Then** the window should open at a reasonable default size that fits on screen
8. **Given** I resize the window to very small dimensions, **When** the window reaches minimum size (800x600), **Then** it should not resize smaller and all elements should remain accessible

### Edge Cases
- **Minimum Size Constraint**: Window cannot be resized below 800x600 pixels to maintain usability
- **Oversized Window Recovery**: If saved dimensions exceed current screen, window opens at 80% of screen size, centered
- **Configuration File Issues**: If config file is corrupted or missing, application uses default window size (1024x768) and recreates config
- **Multi-Monitor Support**: Window position is validated against available screen bounds and adjusted if necessary
- **High DPI Displays**: UI elements scale appropriately on high-resolution displays without becoming too small

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enable the Calculate Position button when all required form fields contain valid data
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute position calculations when the Calculate Position button is clicked
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute position calculations when the Calculate Position menu item is selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST display clear, visible error messages when form validation fails
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to resize the application window
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain proper layout and proportions of all UI elements during window resize operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist window size and position settings between application sessions
- **FR-008**: System MUST store window configuration in a JSON file within ~/.risk_calculator/ directory alongside other application settings
- **FR-009**: System MUST restore saved window dimensions and position on application startup
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle cases where saved window dimensions are invalid for current screen configuration by using defaults (80% of screen size, centered)
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain usability at different window sizes with minimum size constraint of 800x600 pixels
- **FR-012**: System MUST display validation error messages prominently near invalid form fields
- **FR-013**: System MUST ensure error message visibility is maintained during window resize operations

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Window Configuration**: Contains window dimensions, position, and display state information that persists between sessions
- **Form Validation State**: Tracks validation status of all form fields and determines button enablement
- **User Preferences**: Collection of user-specific settings stored in home directory including window configuration
