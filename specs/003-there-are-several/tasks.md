# Tasks: UI Bug Fixes and Window Responsiveness

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-there-are-several/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Extract: Python 3.12+, Tkinter, JSON storage, MVC architecture
2. Load design documents:
   → data-model.md: WindowConfiguration, FieldValidationState, FormValidationState
   → contracts/: ConfigurationService, ValidationService, UIController
   → quickstart.md: 6 major test scenarios with cross-platform verification
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: directory structure, configuration persistence setup
   → Tests: contract tests for 3 services, integration tests for 6 scenarios
   → Core: 3 data models, enhanced services, controller extensions
   → Integration: window management, validation coordination, error display
   → Polish: cross-platform testing, performance validation
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file modifications = sequential (no [P])
   → All tests before implementation (TDD approach)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T030)
6. Validate completeness: All contracts tested, all entities modeled
7. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```
