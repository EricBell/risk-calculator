# Implementation Plan: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

**Branch**: `005-fix-button-deprecate` | **Date**: 2025-09-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-fix-button-deprecate/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Refine the existing Qt-based risk calculator application by completely deprecating the Tkinter version, implementing intelligent Calculate Position button enablement with real-time validation feedback, and ensuring proper application lifecycle management. Primary requirements include removing Tkinter access, adding comprehensive form validation with clear error messaging, and implementing complete process termination on application exit.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Python 3.12+ (preserving existing codebase compatibility)
**Primary Dependencies**: PySide6/Qt6 for UI framework, existing validation services, QSettings for configuration
**Storage**: QSettings for window configuration persistence (Windows Registry, Linux XDG)
**Testing**: pytest with existing test suite structure (contract, integration, unit tests)
**Target Platform**: Windows 10+ and Linux desktop (cross-platform desktop application)
**Project Type**: single (desktop application)
**Performance Goals**: <100ms UI response time, real-time validation feedback, <3s startup
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, offline-capable, no server dependencies, complete process cleanup
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user desktop application, existing codebase refinement, 3 trading asset types

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Desktop-First ✅
- All functionality works without server-side processing: Qt-based local calculations preserved
- Native code handles all calculations locally: Existing Python calculation services maintained
- No backend dependencies for core features: Offline-capable button validation and form management
- Cross-platform compatibility: Qt provides Windows and Linux native support

### II. Native UI Design ✅
- Native desktop experience: Qt provides platform-appropriate widgets and button behavior
- Mouse and keyboard optimized: Qt input handling with real-time validation feedback
- Platform-appropriate UI guidelines: Qt automatically follows platform conventions for buttons and forms

### III. Performance ✅
- Application startup under 3 seconds: Qt generally faster than Tkinter, optimization maintained
- No external dependencies for core functionality: All validation remains local
- Minimal memory footprint: Qt efficient, targeting <100MB with proper process cleanup

### IV. Accessibility ✅
- Platform accessibility standards: Qt provides built-in accessibility APIs for button states
- Keyboard navigation support: Qt widgets include standard keyboard navigation for forms
- Screen reader compatibility: Qt integrates with platform accessibility services for validation feedback

### V. Platform Compatibility ✅
- Support Windows 10+ and Linux: Qt officially supports both target platforms
- Python runtime dependency management: PySide6 available via pip, same as existing
- Graceful handling of missing components: Qt fallback mechanisms for validation edge cases
- Cross-platform executable distribution: Qt + PyInstaller proven packaging solution

**PASS**: All constitutional requirements met. Feature enhances rather than compromises constitutional compliance.

**Structure Decision**: Option 1 (Single project) - Desktop application maintains existing structure with Qt refinements to views and controllers

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved ✅

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file ✅

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Button validation interface contracts → contract test tasks [P]
- Form/Button validation entities → model implementation tasks [P]
- Tkinter deprecation → entry point modification tasks
- Application lifecycle → process management tasks
- Quickstart scenarios → integration test tasks

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before controllers before UI
- Tkinter deprecation can run parallel with validation work [P]
- Process management tasks sequential due to Qt application lifecycle dependencies
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files/features)

**Qt-Specific Task Categories**:
1. **Tkinter Deprecation**: Entry point modification, deprecation warnings
2. **Real-time Validation**: Signal/slot connections, validation service integration
3. **Button State Management**: Qt widget state updates, tooltip management
4. **Process Lifecycle**: Qt application cleanup, resource management
5. **Cross-Tab Consistency**: Equity, Options, Futures validation uniformity

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*
