# Quickstart: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ installed
- PySide6 library installed (`pip install PySide6`)
- Existing Qt-based risk calculator application

## Setup
```bash
# Verify Qt version is accessible
python -c "from risk_calculator.qt_main import main; print('Qt version ready')"

# Verify Tkinter version is deprecated
python -c "from risk_calculator.main import main" # Should show deprecation warning or fail
```

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Tkinter Deprecation Verification
**Objective**: Confirm Tkinter version is completely inaccessible

1. Attempt to run Tkinter version via any known entry point
2. **Expected**: Clear deprecation message directing to Qt version
3. **Expected**: No Tkinter UI should appear
4. **Expected**: Qt version launches automatically or provides clear launch instructions

**Validation**:
- No Tkinter interface accessible to users
- Clear migration messaging provided
- Qt version works as primary interface

### Scenario 2: Calculate Button Enablement - Complete Form
**Objective**: Verify button enables immediately when all fields are complete

1. Launch Qt application
2. Navigate to Equity tab
3. Select "Percentage" risk method
4. Fill in required fields: Account Size: 10000, Risk %: 2, Entry Price: 50, Stop Loss: 48
5. **Expected**: Calculate Position button becomes enabled immediately after last required field
6. **Expected**: No error messages displayed
7. **Expected**: Button tooltip shows ready state

**Validation**:
- Button enabled state updates in real-time
- No delay between field completion and button enablement
- All required fields properly recognized

### Scenario 3: Calculate Button Disabled State with Clear Errors
**Objective**: Verify clear error messages when button is disabled

1. From Scenario 2, clear the "Entry Price" field
2. **Expected**: Calculate Position button becomes disabled immediately
3. **Expected**: Clear error message indicates "Entry Price is required"
4. **Expected**: Button tooltip explains exactly what's missing
5. Fill in Entry Price: 50
6. **Expected**: Button immediately re-enables
7. **Expected**: Error message disappears

**Validation**:
- Specific field-level error messages
- Real-time error state updates
- Clear guidance on what user needs to complete

### Scenario 4: Risk Method Switching Validation
**Objective**: Verify button state updates correctly when switching risk methods

1. Fill complete Equity form for Percentage method
2. **Expected**: Calculate Position button enabled
3. Switch to "Fixed Amount" risk method
4. **Expected**: Button state updates immediately based on new required fields
5. **Expected**: Error messages reflect new field requirements
6. Fill any newly required fields
7. **Expected**: Button re-enables when Fixed Amount requirements met

**Validation**:
- Dynamic field requirement updates
- Immediate validation refresh on method change
- Preservation of valid field data where applicable

### Scenario 5: Cross-Tab Validation Consistency
**Objective**: Verify button validation works identically across all trading types

1. Test complete validation cycle on Equity tab
2. Switch to Options tab
3. **Expected**: Same validation behavior pattern
4. Test complete validation cycle on Futures tab
5. **Expected**: Identical validation responsiveness

**Validation**:
- Consistent validation behavior across all tabs
- Same error message quality and timing
- Uniform button enablement logic

### Scenario 6: Application Exit Process Cleanup
**Objective**: Verify complete process termination on application exit

1. Launch Qt application
2. Perform some calculations to ensure processes are active
3. Close application via window close button
4. **Expected**: Application window closes immediately
5. Check system processes for any remaining risk-calculator processes
6. **Expected**: No orphaned or background processes remain

**Validation**:
- Complete process cleanup
- No memory leaks or hanging processes
- Immediate and clean application termination

### Scenario 7: Rapid Field Changes Performance
**Objective**: Verify validation performs well during rapid user input

1. Navigate to any trading tab
2. Rapidly type and delete content in multiple fields
3. **Expected**: UI remains responsive throughout
4. **Expected**: Validation updates smoothly without lag
5. **Expected**: Button state updates appropriately without flicker

**Validation**:
- UI responsiveness maintained during rapid input
- Smooth validation updates without performance degradation
- Stable button state transitions

## Performance Validation

### Real-time Validation Response
- Field validation must complete within 50ms of input change
- Button state updates must occur within 100ms of validation completion
- Error message display must be immediate (no noticeable delay)

### Application Lifecycle
- Application exit must complete within 2 seconds of user request
- No background processes should remain after exit
- Memory cleanup must be complete

### Cross-Platform Behavior
- Validation timing identical on Windows and Linux
- Error message display consistent across platforms
- Button behavior follows platform UI conventions

## Success Criteria

All scenarios must pass with the following outcomes:
- ✅ Tkinter version completely inaccessible to users
- ✅ Calculate Position button enables immediately when form is complete
- ✅ Clear, specific error messages when button is disabled
- ✅ Real-time validation feedback during user input
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all trading asset types
- ✅ Complete application process cleanup on exit
- ✅ Responsive performance during rapid field changes

## Edge Case Testing

### Boundary Conditions
- Empty fields at application start
- Maximum length input in all fields
- Invalid numeric values in numeric fields
- Special characters in text fields

### Error Recovery
- Network disconnection during validation (should not affect local validation)
- System low memory conditions
- Forced application termination recovery

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Button remains disabled**: Check that all required fields for current risk method are filled
- **Validation slow**: Verify no blocking operations in validation logic
- **Process not terminating**: Check for unclosed Qt resources or threads
- **Error messages unclear**: Verify field-specific validation messaging implementation
