# Feature Specification: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

**Feature Branch**: `005-fix-button-deprecate`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix button - Deprecate the tkinter version of the app so that the Qt version is the one and only version. I also need the calculate position button to be enabled when all the fields are filled out OR I need a clear error message why the button cannot be enabled. Lastly, when the app is exited stop/kill the app in memory."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a day trader using the risk calculator application, I want to use a single, reliable version of the application where the Calculate Position button works intuitively - either enabling when all required fields are completed or showing me exactly what's missing - and I want enhanced options trading with level-based risk calculations and stop loss price functionality just like equities, plus I want the application to completely close when I exit it without leaving background processes running.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has both Tkinter and Qt versions available, **When** they attempt to run the application, **Then** only the Qt version should be accessible and functional
2. **Given** the user is on any trading tab (Equity, Options, Futures), **When** they fill in all required fields for their selected risk method, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled immediately
3. **Given** the user is on the Options tab, **When** they select level-based risk method and enter premium, entry price, support/resistance level, and trade direction, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled and calculates contracts using underlying price movement
4. **Given** the user is on the Options tab with any risk method, **When** they enter premium, entry price, and stop loss price (similar to equities), **Then** risk calculations account for underlying stock price movement between entry and stop loss
5. **Given** the user is on any trading tab with incomplete form data, **When** they try to understand why the Calculate Position button is disabled, **Then** clear error messages indicate exactly which fields need completion
6. **Given** the user has the application running, **When** they close the application window or exit the application, **Then** all application processes terminate completely with no background processes remaining

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user has partially filled forms and switches between risk calculation methods?
- How does the system handle rapid field changes while validation is occurring?
- What happens if the user forcibly terminates the application during a calculation?
- How does the system behave on different operating systems when closing the application?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent access to the Tkinter version of the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide only the Qt version as the primary and sole application interface
- **FR-003**: Calculate Position button MUST become enabled immediately when all required fields for the selected risk method are completed and valid
- **FR-004**: System MUST display clear, specific error messages indicating which fields are missing or invalid when the Calculate Position button is disabled
- **FR-005**: Error messages MUST update in real-time as users modify form fields
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all input fields according to the selected risk calculation method (percentage, fixed amount, or level-based)
- **FR-007**: Application MUST completely terminate all processes when the user exits the application
- **FR-008**: System MUST not leave any background processes running after application closure
- **FR-009**: Button enablement logic MUST work identically across all trading asset types (Equity, Options, Futures)
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all existing risk calculation functionality and accuracy during the transition
- **FR-011**: Options tab MUST support level-based risk calculation method (in addition to percentage-based and fixed amount methods)
- **FR-012**: Options tab MUST include stop loss price field for risk calculations based on underlying stock price movement
- **FR-013**: Level-based method for options MUST use support/resistance levels and trade direction to calculate appropriate number of contracts
- **FR-014**: All three risk methods (percentage, fixed amount, level-based) MUST be available and functional for all asset classes (Equity, Options, Futures)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Form Validation State**: Represents the current validation status of all input fields, including which fields are complete, invalid, or missing
- **Button State**: Represents the enabled/disabled status of the Calculate Position button and associated error messaging
- **Application Process**: Represents the running application instance and its lifecycle management requirements
