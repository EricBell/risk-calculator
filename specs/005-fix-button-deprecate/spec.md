# Feature Specification: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

**Feature Branch**: `005-fix-button-deprecate`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: In Progress
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-25
**Input**: User description: "Fix button - Deprecate the tkinter version of the app so that the Qt version is the one and only version. I also need the calculate position button to be enabled when all the fields are filled out OR I need a clear error message why the button cannot be enabled. Lastly, when the app is exited stop/kill the app in memory."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a day trader using the risk calculator application, I want to use a single, reliable version of the application where the Calculate Position button works intuitively - either enabling when all required fields are completed or showing me exactly what's missing - and I want enhanced options trading with proper stop loss risk calculations that size positions based on the actual risk between premium and stop loss price rather than just premium cost, plus I want the application to completely close when I exit it without leaving background processes running.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the user has both Tkinter and Qt versions available, **When** they attempt to run the application, **Then** only the Qt version should be accessible and functional
2. **Given** the user is on any trading tab (Equity, Options, Futures), **When** they fill in all required fields for their selected risk method, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled immediately
3. **Given** the user is on the Options tab, **When** they select level-based risk method and enter premium, support/resistance level, and trade direction, **Then** the Calculate Position button becomes enabled and calculates contracts using underlying price movement
4. **Given** the user is on the Options tab with percentage or fixed amount risk method, **When** they enter premium and stop loss price, **Then** position sizing is calculated based on |Premium - Stop Loss| × Multiplier rather than premium cost alone
5. **Given** the user is on the Options tab with SHORT direction, **When** they enter premium ($0.56) and stop loss ($0.65), **Then** risk per contract = $0.09 × 100 = $9.00 and position sizing uses this risk amount
6. **Given** the user is on any trading tab with incomplete form data, **When** they try to understand why the Calculate Position button is disabled, **Then** clear error messages indicate exactly which fields need completion
7. **Given** the user has the application running, **When** they close the application window or exit the application, **Then** all application processes terminate completely with no background processes remaining

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user has partially filled forms and switches between risk calculation methods?
- How does the system handle rapid field changes while validation is occurring?
- What happens if the user enters invalid stop loss values (e.g., stop loss = premium for options)?
- How does the system handle options with very small risk per contract calculations?
- What happens if the user forcibly terminates the application during a calculation?
- How does the system behave on different operating systems when closing the application?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST prevent access to the Tkinter version of the application
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide only the Qt version as the primary and sole application interface
- **FR-003**: Calculate Position button MUST become enabled immediately when all required fields for the selected risk method are completed and valid
- **FR-004**: System MUST display clear, specific error messages indicating which fields are missing or invalid when the Calculate Position button is disabled
- **FR-005**: Error messages MUST update in real-time as users modify form fields
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate all input fields according to the selected risk calculation method (percentage, fixed amount, or level-based)
- **FR-007**: Application MUST completely terminate all processes when the user exits the application
- **FR-008**: System MUST not leave any background processes running after application closure
- **FR-009**: Button enablement logic MUST work identically across all trading asset types (Equity, Options, Futures)
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve all existing risk calculation functionality and accuracy during the transition
- **FR-011**: Options tab MUST support all three risk calculation methods: percentage-based, fixed amount, AND level-based
- **FR-012**: Options tab MUST include stop loss price field as a required field for percentage-based and fixed amount methods
- **FR-013**: Options level-based method MUST use support/resistance levels and trade direction to calculate appropriate number of contracts
- **FR-014**: Options risk calculations MUST use stop loss risk formula for percentage/fixed methods: Risk per Contract = |Premium - Stop Loss| × Contract Multiplier
- **FR-015**: Options position sizing MUST be based on risk per contract rather than premium cost for percentage/fixed methods: Contracts = Risk Amount / Risk per Contract
- **FR-016**: All three risk methods (percentage, fixed amount, level-based) MUST be available and functional for all asset classes (Equity, Options, Futures)
- **FR-017**: Options calculation results MUST display stop loss price, risk per share, risk per contract, and position sizing explanation for percentage/fixed methods
- **FR-018**: System MUST validate that stop loss price is logically correct relative to trade direction for percentage/fixed methods (SHORT: stop > premium, LONG: stop < premium)

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Form Validation State**: Represents the current validation status of all input fields, including which fields are complete, invalid, or missing
- **Button State**: Represents the enabled/disabled status of the Calculate Position button and associated error messaging
- **Application Process**: Represents the running application instance and its lifecycle management requirements

## Implementation Notes
*Recent changes and progress updates*

### Completed (2025-09-25):
- **Options All Three Risk Methods**: Implemented percentage-based, fixed amount, AND level-based risk calculations for options (bringing options to parity with equities)
- **Options Stop Loss Enhancement**: Added stop loss price field to options percentage and fixed amount risk methods
- **Risk Calculation Fix**: Updated options calculations to use `|Premium - Stop Loss| × Multiplier` instead of premium cost alone for percentage/fixed methods
- **Level-Based Implementation**: Added support/resistance levels and trade direction for options level-based risk calculations
- **Position Sizing Improvement**: Modified position sizing to be based on actual risk per contract rather than premium cost
- **Enhanced Results Display**: Updated calculation results to show stop loss price, risk per share, risk per contract, and detailed explanations
- **Validation Updates**: Modified validation service to require stop loss price for percentage/fixed methods
- **User Interface Improvements**: Updated informational text to clarify stop loss requirements and calculation methods

### Example Calculation (implemented):
- Premium: $0.56, Stop Loss: $0.65 (SHORT position)
- Risk per Share: |$0.56 - $0.65| = $0.09
- Risk per Contract: $0.09 × 100 = $9.00
- Fixed Risk: $50 → Contracts: $50 ÷ $9 = 5 contracts

### Still Pending:
- Tkinter version deprecation
- Calculate button validation improvements
- Application process cleanup on exit
