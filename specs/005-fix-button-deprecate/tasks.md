# Tasks: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/005-fix-button-deprecate/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   → Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   → data-model.md: Extract entities → model tasks
   → contracts/: Each file → contract test task
   → research.md: Extract decisions → setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Tkinter deprecation, dependency verification
   → Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   → Core: validation models, button state management
   → Integration: Qt signal/slot connections, process lifecycle
   → Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   → All contracts have tests?
   → All entities have models?
   → All quickstart scenarios implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

```

## Notes
- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- Verify contract tests fail before implementing interfaces
- Preserve existing business logic during Qt enhancement
- Test on both Windows and Linux throughout development
- Maintain existing calculation accuracy exactly
- Commit after each task completion

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - button_validation_interface.py → T005-T008 (FormValidation, ButtonState, ApplicationLifecycle, TkinterDeprecation)

2. **From Data Model**:
   - Form Validation State → T016 (model creation)
   - Button State → T017 (model creation)
   - Field Validation State → T018 (model creation)
   - Application Process State → T019 (model creation)

3. **From Quickstart Scenarios**:
   - Scenario 1 → T009 (Tkinter deprecation verification)
   - Scenario 2 → T010 (button enablement complete form)
   - Scenario 3 → T011 (button disabled with errors)
   - Scenario 4 → T012 (risk method switching)
   - Scenario 5 → T013 (cross-tab consistency)
   - Scenario 6 → T014 (application exit cleanup)
   - Scenario 7 → T015 (rapid field changes performance)

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup → Tests → Models → Services → UI Integration → Signal/Slot → Lifecycle → Polish
   - Qt-specific dependencies: Models before services, services before UI, UI before signals

## Validation Checklist
*GATE: Checked by main() before returning*

- [x] All contracts have corresponding tests (T005-T008)
- [x] All entities have model tasks (T016-T019)
- [x] All tests come before implementation (T005-T015 before T016+)
- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (different files)
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Qt-specific requirements addressed (signals, validation, lifecycle)
- [x] Existing functionality preservation validated (business logic unchanged)
- [x] Cross-platform compatibility ensured (Windows + Linux)

## Critical Success Criteria
- **Tkinter Completely Deprecated**: No user can access Tkinter version (T001-T004, T009)
- **Real-time Button Validation**: Button enables immediately when form complete (T010, T024-T029)
- **Clear Error Messages**: User knows exactly why button disabled (T011, T037-T040)
- **Process Cleanup**: Complete termination on exit (T014, T034-T036)
- **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Identical behavior on Windows and Linux (T050)
- **Performance Standards**: <50ms validation, <2s exit time (T048-T049)

## File Impact Summary
**Modified Files**: 12+ Qt view and controller files
**New Files**: 19+ model, service, and test files
**Deprecated Files**: 1 main Tkinter entry point
**Risk Level**: Medium (button enablement logic is critical UX)
**Test Coverage**: 100% of button enablement and deprecation scenarios
