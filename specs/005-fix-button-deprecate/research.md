# Research: Qt Application Refinement and Tkinter Deprecation

## Tkinter Deprecation Strategy

### Decision: Complete removal of Tkinter entry points
**Rationale**:
- Eliminates user confusion between two UI frameworks
- Consolidates maintenance effort on single Qt codebase
- Prevents accidental usage of deprecated interface
- Simplifies deployment and distribution

**Alternatives considered**: Gradual deprecation with warnings rejected due to prolonged maintenance burden and user confusion.

## Button Enablement Validation

### Decision: Real-time Qt signal-based validation with immediate feedback
**Rationale**:
- Qt's signal/slot system provides optimal performance for real-time updates
- Immediate user feedback improves user experience significantly
- Leverages existing validation services without duplication
- Platform-appropriate validation behavior through Qt widgets

**Alternatives considered**: Polling-based validation rejected due to performance impact and less responsive user experience.

## Form Validation Error Display

### Decision: Field-specific error messaging with visual indicators
**Rationale**:
- Clear error communication reduces user frustration
- Field-level validation provides precise guidance
- Qt's built-in error styling maintains platform consistency
- Real-time error clearing improves workflow efficiency

**Alternatives considered**: Modal error dialogs rejected as they interrupt user workflow and are less accessible.

## Application Lifecycle Management

### Decision: Qt application lifecycle with QCoreApplication.quit() integration
**Rationale**:
- Ensures complete process termination across platforms
- Leverages Qt's built-in application lifecycle management
- Handles cleanup of Qt resources automatically
- Provides consistent behavior on Windows and Linux

**Alternatives considered**: Manual process management rejected due to platform inconsistencies and complexity.

## Risk Method Switching Validation

### Decision: Dynamic field requirement updates with immediate button state refresh
**Rationale**:
- Different risk methods require different field combinations
- Immediate validation prevents user confusion
- Preserves partially entered data when switching methods
- Maintains calculation accuracy across method changes

**Alternatives considered**: Form reset on method change rejected as it would lose user input and create poor experience.

## Cross-Platform Process Management

### Decision: Platform-appropriate cleanup mechanisms
**Rationale**:
- Windows and Linux have different process cleanup behaviors
- Qt handles platform differences transparently
- QApplication.quit() provides proper cleanup on both platforms
- Prevents memory leaks and orphaned processes

**Alternatives considered**: Platform-specific cleanup code rejected due to maintenance complexity and Qt's superior built-in handling.

## Performance Optimization for Real-time Validation

### Decision: Debounced validation with immediate button state updates
**Rationale**:
- Prevents excessive validation calls during rapid typing
- Maintains responsive user interface
- Reduces CPU usage while preserving user experience
- Optimizes for both performance and usability

**Alternatives considered**: Validation on focus loss rejected as it provides delayed feedback and poor user experience.

## Error Message Internationalization Preparation

### Decision: Structured error message system compatible with Qt's internationalization
**Rationale**:
- Prepares application for future localization needs
- Maintains consistent error message formatting
- Leverages Qt's built-in internationalization support
- Improves accessibility through standardized messaging

**Alternatives considered**: Hard-coded error messages rejected due to future localization limitations and maintenance difficulties.
