# Risk Calculator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Static-First
All functionality must work without server-side processing; JavaScript handles all calculations client-side; No backend dependencies for core features.

### II. Responsive Design
Application must work on mobile, tablet, and desktop; Touch-friendly interface required; Viewport must scale appropriately.

### III. Performance
Initial page load under 3 seconds; No external dependencies for core functionality; Minimal JavaScript bundle size.

### IV. Accessibility
WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required; Keyboard navigation support; Screen reader compatibility.

### V. Browser Compatibility
Support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge); Progressive enhancement approach; Graceful degradation for older browsers.

## File Structure
Static assets organized in logical directories; HTML, CSS, JS separation maintained; Build process outputs to single deployable directory.

## Deployment
Single directory deployment to any static hosting; No server configuration required; CDN-ready asset organization.

## Governance
Constitution defines minimum viable static web app standards; Changes require testing on target deployment platforms; Performance budgets must be maintained.
