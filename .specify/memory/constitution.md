# Risk Calculator Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Desktop-First
All functionality must work without server-side processing; Native code handles all calculations locally; No backend dependencies for core features; Cross-platform compatibility for Windows and Linux.

### II. Native UI Design
Application must provide native desktop experience on target platforms (Windows and Linux); Mouse and keyboard optimized interface; Platform-appropriate UI guidelines compliance.

### III. Performance
Application startup under 3 seconds; No external dependencies for core functionality; Minimal memory footprint and efficient resource usage.

### IV. Accessibility
Platform accessibility standards compliance; Keyboard navigation support; Screen reader compatibility through platform APIs.

### V. Platform Compatibility
Support Windows 10+ and modern Linux distributions; Python runtime dependency management; Graceful handling of missing system components; Cross-platform executable distribution.

## File Structure
Project files organized in logical directories; Models, Views, Controllers separation maintained; Build process outputs to single executable or installer package.

## Deployment
Single executable or installer package deployment; No server configuration required; Cross-platform distribution (Windows .exe, Linux binary); Python runtime bundling options.

## Governance
Constitution defines minimum viable cross-platform desktop app standards; Changes require testing on target platforms (Windows and Linux); Performance budgets must be maintained.
