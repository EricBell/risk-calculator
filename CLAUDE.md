# Claude Code Context: Risk Calculator

## Project Overview
Cross-platform desktop application for daytrading risk calculation using Python and Tkinter. Runs on Windows and Linux. Provides tabbed interface for calculating position sizes across equities, options, and futures based on account risk tolerance.

## Specification Source
This project was implemented using the GitHub Spec Kit methodology:
**Spec Kit URL**: https://github.com/github/spec-kit

The project specification is located in `/specs/001-create-a-windows/` following the spec kit structure.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python 3.12+
- **UI Framework**: Tkinter (Python standard library)
- **Architecture**: MVC with separation of concerns
- **Testing**: pytest with unittest.mock
- **Target**: Windows 10+ and Linux desktop application

## Key Dependencies
- Python 3.12+ standard library (tkinter, decimal, dataclasses, typing)
- pytest (testing framework)
- pytest-mock (mocking for tests)
- PyInstaller (deployment packaging)

## Current Status
**Phase**: Implementation Complete ✅
**Status**: Fully functional cross-platform desktop application

**Implementation Completed**:
- ✅ Complete MVC architecture with 7 models, 3 services, 5 controllers, 5 views
- ✅ All three risk calculation methods working (percentage, fixed amount, level-based)
- ✅ Multi-asset support (equities, options, futures) with method restrictions
- ✅ Real-time validation and professional Tkinter UI
- ✅ 17/17 core service tests passing (100% success rate)
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility (Python 3.12+ with Tkinter)

## Key Features
1. **Tabbed Interface**: Separate tabs for Equities, Options, Futures
2. **Risk Calculation**: Percentage-based position sizing with stop loss
3. **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
4. **Session Persistence**: Maintain inputs within application session
5. **Performance**: <100ms calculations, <50MB memory usage

## Business Logic
- **Equities**: Shares = (Account × Risk%) / (Entry - StopLoss)
- **Options**: Contracts = (Account × Risk%) / (Premium × 100)
- **Futures**: Contracts = (Account × Risk%) / (TickValue × TicksAtRisk)

## Next Steps
Ready for `/tasks` command to generate implementation tasks from design artifacts.

## Current Feature: Calculate Position Button Fix
**Branch**: `002-the-calculate-position`
**Issue**: Calculate Position button remains disabled despite complete form input across all tabs
**Specification**: `/specs/002-the-calculate-position/` (spec.md, plan.md, research.md, quickstart.md)

**Key Implementation Details**:
- Button enablement logic in `BaseController._update_calculate_button_state()`
- Real-time validation via StringVar trace callbacks
- Method-specific required fields in each controller's `get_required_fields()`
- Validation service integration for error checking

## Recent Changes
